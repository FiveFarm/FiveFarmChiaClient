# Getting Started with FiveFarm

FiveFarm offers a Chia farm management and analytics platform where you can integrate your Chia farming pools and the entire network to view and analyze all your stats in one place. The system enables users to manage their harvester network from a single UI where they can manage harvester plotting and can access the complete information of the farm. 

Using our plot manager integration, users can customize the plotting on any system. Customization allows users to create maximum plots every day and make efficient use of the system’s power.  

This guide gives step-by-step instructions on ‘How you can set up FiveFarm on your network’.
<br /><br />
#### Step:1

## 5Farm Dashboard

5Farm Dashboard gives information on three modules.

1)	Chia Blockchain
2)	Farm
3)	Pools


#### 1. Chia Blockchain


Chia Blockchain gives a statistical overview of your Chia Network. You can manage your harvesters network from a single UI. It shows the ‘Difficulty’ of farming Chia. You can view the live, daily, weekly, and monthly difficulty levels of the entire Chia Network. 
<br /><br />
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106319556/175889048-0a218abd-a03a-4aeb-b938-7ae3b189ea83.png)




Other than this, users can see their full node information such as blockchain syncing status, connection status, network, peak height and time, block iterations, and VDF slot iterations on the dashboard.

##### Estimated Network Space: 
Estimated sum of all the plotted disk space of all farmers in the network
##### VDF Sub Slot Iterations: 
Sub-slot is a segment of a fixed number of VDF iterations, subject to work difficulty adjustment, always adjusting to a target fixed amount of time (i.e. 10 mins). Sub-slot iterations refer to a constant which is periodically adjusted and determines how many VDF iterations each sub-slot should have.
##### Total Iterations: 
Total iterations since the start of the blockchain.

 #### 2. Farm 

The second module is ‘Farm’ where you can see complete information about your farm. 

●	XCH Total Chia Farmed.<br />
●	Total Points Balance.<br />
●	Total Pools Connected.<br />
●	Total Pool Points.<br />
●	Total DG Plots Count.<br />
●	Total Portable Plots Count.<br />
●	Total Plot Size.<br />
●	Estimated Time of Win.<br />
●	Pools associated with the Farm.<br />
●	Last Attempted Proof.<br />
●	Latest Block Challenges. <br />
●	Connections.<br />
<br /><br />

#### 3. Pools

The third module in 5Farm is ‘Pools’ where you can manage and monitor multiple pools you have joined. 

Here you get a statistical view of multiple launcher IDs in one place.
<br /><br />
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106319556/175889197-eae55169-cef4-4518-923e-58e762efc725.png)

 <br /><br /><br />

You can see the Estimated Plot Size, Unpaid XCH, Total Paid XCH, and PPLNS Points of each pool. Click on ‘View Detail’ to get more information about a particular pool.
<br /><br />
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106319556/175889219-22e252ce-91d2-4132-a05c-4556c87cc549.png)


 

Here you will get the summary of the pool. You can see the total number of blocks found by the pool and the round share of each farmer. 
<br /><br />
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106319556/175889249-599c24d2-46f6-454a-8f19-d6c6514340f7.png)
<br /><br /><br />
 

The graphical representation shows you the Netspace in the pool, the effective space, and the average effective space. 
<br /><br />
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106319556/175889269-f18b0d75-4b7e-4340-96c8-69babf6df9ac.png)

 <br /><br /><br />

The pool information also gives a 24-hour overview of current difficulty, harvesters, valid partials, invalid partials, and stale partials.  
<br /><br />

 <br /><br /><br />

You can see details of harvesters based on harvester ID, the difficulty level, status, and proof. 
<br /><br />

 <br /><br /><br />

You can also add another pool that is not part of the current network. Give details and click on ‘Add Pool’.

 <br /><br /><br />


Continue using FiveFarm to manage full node plots as well as all the harvesters and their plots. A unified GUI can help you see the progress of each plot and errors in every phase. Moreover, you can use plot manager configurations to optimize the running plots by using and modifying the RAM memory and CPU threads intelligently in every phase of plotting.

# FAQs

#### 1. Are my keys safe?
    ‘FiveFarm ChiaClient’ does not require your private keys. It only uses ‘farm summary’, ‘farm challenges’, and ‘plotnft show’ commands to collect the farmer stats, and of peers connected to the full node. 

#### 2. Is my Wallet Balance Safe?
     Since we do not collect your private keys, FiveFarm Chia Client doesn't do anything with the Wallet balance. No transactions can be performed.

#### 3. I am asked for a Passphrase at the login screen. Is it not my security breach?
     FiveFarm ChiaClient uses Passphrase just for collecting Farmer stats as it is required by Chia Blockchain. We neither store Passphrase nor send it to the Server. Source code is available on GitHub. 

#### 4. How is this platform trustworthy?
     Complete source code for the FiveFarm Chia client is available on GitHub here.

#### 5. What data does FiveFarm collect?
    FiveFarm Chia Client collects information about your farm including statistics and sends it to the server. These statistics are available in your dashboard for review.

#### 6. What if I don't want to store my data on your server anymore?
    You can uninstall the client from the chia farm and delete your account from the server. All data associated with this account is deleted immediately and purged.

#### 7. How can I contact you for any help or queries?
    You can contact us at support@fiverfarm.app
